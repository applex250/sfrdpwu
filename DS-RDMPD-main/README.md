We combined the traditional UNet model with the diffusion model to propose a two-stage network architecture, DS-RDMPD. This model achieved satisfactory results in remote sensing dehazing, real-world raindrop removal, and real-world denoising, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. The paper can be found in the link above.

### 🚀 Getting Started

We train and test the code on **PyTorch 1.13.0 + CUDA 11.7**. The detailed configuration is mentioned in the paper.

### Create a new conda environment
<pre lang="markdown">conda create -n DSRDMPD python=3.8 
conda activate DSRDMPD  </pre>

###  ⚠️ Notice
Remember to modify the path to the dataset before running the test and training code. Different image resolutions require modifying the relevant parameter parameters.
